This C++ program is a simple command-line food billing system that allows users to place orders for vegetarian or non-vegetarian items. It guides users through a menu selection process, calculates the total bill based on their choices, and handles invalid inputs by prompting users to try again. After the user finalizes their order, the system displays the final bill amount. This project demonstrates basic input handling, conditional statements, and loop constructs in C++.
